# UFOs

## Overview

This project created a page, using Javascript, to provide filterable data to potential users searching for information on various UFO sightings. Users can filter through the provided table data based on date, location, or even a UFO’s shape, to help easily gather relevant information. The result is a table of data that will help UFO enthusiasts gain more information of the unknown!

## Results

Visitors to the page will see a sizeable table of data. Each row represents a specific UFO sighting detailing the date, city state and country, UFO shape, the duration and a description of the encounter. To narrow results, users can use the “Filter Search” box to eliminate rows that are not necessary and make the table more approachable. the images below show the page upon landing, and after a search was entered. In the second image, a user has used the "Filter Search" box, "Enter State", to enter the state "fl." As shown, this returns only those sighting reported in the state of Florida, allowing the user to find what they need quickly and easily.

## Summary

While the filtered search is straightforward and easy to navigate, the page would be more user-friendly if there was a “clear search” button so that users could quickly clear a search and begin a new one.  Additionally, while multiple searches for different criteria can be run, such as specifying one date and one state, users may wish to search for multiple states at one time, which currently cannot be done.
